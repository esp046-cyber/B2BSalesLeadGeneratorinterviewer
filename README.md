Stage 1 – Screening (5 questions replaced)
Old: Generic "explain B2B lead gen" definitions
New: Real hiring scenarios — "Walk me through your first 30 days", "We have a stale 2,000-contact database — what do you do?", "You got 2 replies from 12 messages — what went wrong?", handling a real live objection, and a shortfall accountability question
Stage 3 – Scenarios (3 cases replaced)
Old: Abstract percentage problems
New: The Unresponsive Database (120 messages, 4 replies, founder asks why), The Meeting Quality Dispute (hit target of 11 but 8 were wrong fit), The Ghost Lead (warm prospect gone silent after proposal)
Stage 4 – Mindset (4 questions replaced)
Old: Simple "what do you do" situations
New: No playbook, first day pressure; taking founder criticism; striking at a live prospect 8pm IST; honest self-assessment conversation with manager
Stage 4 – Objections (3 scenarios replaced)
Old: Generic "we're not looking" responses
New: "We did a procurement software evaluation last year and stayed on spreadsheets", "I'm not the right person", "We're too busy — maybe Q2" — all with nuanced 3-way answer analysis
Stage 4 – UK Culture (4 questions replaced)
Old: Simple "what does this phrase mean"
New: Real follow-up strategy, decoding "interesting" in context, interpreting a Friday Slack message, and raising a data-backed strategic disagreement with a founder
